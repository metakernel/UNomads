# UNomads
UNomads is a multi-platforms development,build and dependencies management software for Unreal Engine.

The ultimate goal of UNomads is to give a complete set of toolings for fast development, custom engine build workflows, projects and their distributions amongs teams.

## Here is an overview of some features that i want to add:
- Plugins Creation: Initialize new plugins with a lot more control then when doing it from the UE Editor. Split the plugins into modules and configure them.
- Module Editor: Generate new modules, configure them and use the refactoring tool to do daunting tasks like module name changes accross all plugin.
- BuildGraph Node Editor: Generate custom BuildGraph scripts from ui (Will feel a bit like a blueprint editor)
- Custom UnrealEngine distribution & game project sync: Init and sync your prebuilt UE version and projects with a single click.
- Generate a new Engine Build from the ui.
- Set the same development environment for everyone with just a click.
- Add your custom engine to the windows registry
- Cross-platform: Leveraging Avalonia, will run on Windows, Linux and MacOs(Wont be able to test this last one myself).
- More to come...
