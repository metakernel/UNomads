# UNomads
UNomads is a build and dependency management software for UnrealEngine.

The ultimate goal of UNomads is to give a complete set of toolings for custom engine build, project and their distribution amongs teams. It is primarly made with git as VCS but will add perforce binding eventually.

In game development most of the team dont have the knowledge to manage source control, dependancies and such so UNomads will provide a customisable pipeline through its easy to use gui interface and will let the complexity of managing build pipeline in the admins/engineers hands.

! This project will be used extensively at Deuzspark Technology, so expect it to grow as we progress in the developmment of our own custom UE5 engine development.
